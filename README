== Why this fork of the fork and not the original rss2email? ==

The fork looked better than the original, but the fork
didn't install properly on OS X so I forked it and made
it work on OS X.

== Why this fork and not the original rss2email? ==

Respect for your $HOME, keeping it clean.
Good for your sanity, especially if you keep your $HOME
under version control

* adherence to XDG basedir spec
* plaintext, humanreadeble config file
* state in separate file, using pickle
* DEFAULT_TO goes in config.py

Added bonus:
things get simpler, you don't need r2e actions like
list/delete/add/reset: since everything is in regular files,
you can use your normal text editing tools
No need for special id's to refer to feeds, just the url.

And finally: avoid dangling locks.  Or locks alltogether.
Using the wrapper script, you avoid running the process twice.

All this applies to *nix users.  I guess these principles can be ported
to work on Windows as well, but I leave that to someone else.

Other improvements:
- better logging / debugging using python builtins over NIH cruft
- support for temporary disabling feeds (by commenting them out)
- markdown readme, not in html directly
- optional script to list broken feeds

However, unlike the original rss2email, this fork:
 * has no support for Windows
 * has no webUI
 both are possible, but I don't need them

== Dependencies ==
 * python (2.3 or higher)
 * feedparser (4.1 or higher)
 * html2text (2.37 or higher)
 * optional: sendmail or sendmail-compatible MTA (can also smtp to remote host)
 * optional: posix sh shell for optional shellscript

== Defining your feeds ==

    $EDITOR $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/r2e/feeds

Each feed on a line, if you want to customize the email adress to send to,
put whitespace after the url and then the email address.
You can temporarily disable feeds by commenting them out (prefix with a '#').

== Running rss2email ==
When you run rss2email, it emails you about every story it hasn't seen before.
But the first time you run it, that will be every story. To avoid this,
you can ask rss2email not to send you any stories the first time you run it:

  r2e run --no-send

Then later, you can ask it to email you new stories:

    r2e run

You probably want to set things up so that this command is run repeatedly.
Cron is your friend.

If you get an error message "Sender domain must exist",
add a line to `config.py` like this:

    DEFAULT_FROM = rss2email@yoursite.com

You can make the email address whatever you want,
but your mail server requires that the yoursite.com part actually exists.


== Configuration ==

There are a some configuration options.
They are described along with their default values at the top of rss2email.py.
To override them, create a new config.py or base yourself on the example one
shipped with this program. (usually found in /usr/share/rss2email)

    $EDITOR $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/r2e/config.py

Some examples:

If you want to receive HTML mail, instead of having entries converted
to plain text:

    HTML_MAIL = 1

To be notified every time a post changes,
instead of just when it's first posted:

    TRUST_GUID = 0

And to make the emails look as if they were sent when the item was posted:

  DATE_HEADER = 1

For a full overview of options, please refer to rss2email.py or
the sample config.py

== Opml import/export ==

Use this to generate a opml export of all your active feeds,
which you can store in an .opml file:

	rss2email.py opmlexport

Similarly, you can generate a plaintext view of an opml file, suitable for
storing in your $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/r2e/feeds like this:

	rss2email.py opmlimport <filename>
